# **Generator-Snippod-Hackathon (Dropped)** readme

## Overview

[**Generator-Snippod-Hackathon**](https://github.com/shalomeir/generator-snippod-hackathon) is a starter kit like [yeogurt](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt) boilerplate. This boilerplate was made for **Snippod's baseline**.
We'd like to this service based on full stack single page web application architecture.
Snippod's first architecture used a this kind of technology, **React + Flux (RefluxJS) + Express (Node.js) + Mongo DB**.
[This stack](http://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/7401617) is presented by diagram too.

**But we decide server side stack use a django REST Framework. So I dropped this stack.** 

## Base Repository, Module

[Generator-Snippod-Hackathon](https://github.com/shalomeir/generator-snippod-hackathon) is based on [Yeogurt Generator](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt). 
And we recommend to check this [react-tweets](https://github.com/scotch-io/react-tweets) examples.

Also we made this using these technologies.

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Reflux](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs)
* [Expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) and [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

## Getting Started

This generator is based on [Yeogurt Generator](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt). So please follow that install guide.

### Usage

- `grunt` for testing and building a production version of your site.
- `grunt serve` for previewing your site/app on a development server.
- `grunt serve:docs` is the same as `grunt serve` but will also re-compile you automated documentation.
- `grunt serve:dist` for previewing a production version of your site/app.

And then 'node server' for excuting server. I separate command with grunt code. (for IDE debug mode)
